# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
Create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by a foundation (example company Alphabet Soup).
- Using Pandas and the Scikit-Learnâ€™s StandardScaler(), preprocess a dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate a neural network model.
- Using TensorFlow, design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if a funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset.
- Using TensorFlow, optimize the model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

## Results:
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

- Data Preprocessing
  - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary:
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model.

Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
